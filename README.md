# JCBooBot
 A betting bot for the FFT Battleground Twitch stream
 Learned how to code it (and set it up!) at this website https://dev.to/ninjabunny9000/let-s-make-a-twitch-bot-with-python-2nd8
 It *will* need more directories to store results and tournament data and all of that (It might create them itself? I don't know, added them in manually while I was coding it). Please don't use this to spam the stream, that would be super rude. Thank youuuuuu!
